# watchList
A movie app to keep track of movies that you have watched

This Project used JS and CSS with Bootstrap to develop a frontend, and Node for the backend with axios for http request.
The database I used was MongoDB which allowed me to practic usign CRUD operations with the database.

The app allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete movies from a list. The app also makes an API request to an IMDB Api to get imageUrl that it displays.
All of this is stored in the DB.

I wanted to add an extra feature to the project so I ended up implementing a search functionality that allows the user to search through everything in the DB while only displaying the items that match.

I have some images of the project in this directory.
I would love to talk about this project in more detail if you have any questions.
